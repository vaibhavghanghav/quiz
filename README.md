# Quiz Practice App

This is my first project created as part of my learning journey with Flutter. The Quiz Practice App is designed to help users practice and enhance their knowledge through interactive quizzes.

## Features

- Choose from various quiz categories.
- Answer multiple-choice questions.
- Keep track of scores.
- Review answers with detailed explanations.
- Compete on the leaderboard.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Quiz Practice App, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up Flutter on your system if you haven't already.
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
4. Run the app on an emulator or physical device using `flutter run`.

Feel free to explore the code, make improvements, and customize it according to your preferences. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to add more features to the app, such as:

- Offline mode support
- Integration with a backend server for user accounts and data synchronization
- Enhanced leaderboard functionality
- Improved UI/UX design

Stay tuned for updates!
